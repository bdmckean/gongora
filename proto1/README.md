# Gongora prototype 1

In this phase of the project we try to use a NAT tunneling program to send messages between two clients that are behind fire walls.

Each client will set up a domain and then a message will be sent from one to the other
The second client will echo the message back to the first


Goals: Demonstrate that we can use a NAT tunneling protocol to set up communiction between two machines behind firewalls

1. The addresses will be out of band for now
2. message send an recieve will be simple command line
